This is very important, you must remember it; You only can get the right decrypting file by using the same key during entrypting.\r\n\r\nThe configuration item ``Segment Type`` only support two values now. \r\n\r\n#### Smart Segment\r\nIt is the recommended type for configuration. Because, it is so fast to encrypt the file blocks.\r\n\r\nIt will not encrypt all the file blocks, it will get the file blocks by a quick and easy strategy and only encrypt those blocks.\r\n\r\nIt is very suitable for those huge files, like vedio and HD picture. \r\n\r\n#### Simple Segment\r\nThis type of configuration will be slow during encrypting.\r\nIt will encrypt most of the file blocks, of course, we can configure it details.\r\n\r\nSo, it is used when you need keep your file higher security.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![start window][2]\r\n![adding file][3]\r\n![blocks show][4]\r\n![smart conf][5]\r\n![smart conf - blocks][6]\r\n![simple conf - progress][7]\r\n![blocks dynamic][8]\r\n![progress dynamic][9]\r\n![file status][10]\r\n![localization][11]\r\n\r\n [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\r\n [2]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap01.png\r\n [3]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap02.png\r\n [4]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap03.png\r\n [5]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap04.png\r\n [6]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap05.png\r\n [7]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap06.png\r\n [8]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap07.png\r\n [9]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap08.png\r\n [10]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap09.png\r\n [11]: https://github.com/daileyet/ViMixer/blob/master/screenshots/Snap10.png\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
